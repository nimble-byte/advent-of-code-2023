# Advent of Code 2023

This repo contains my solutions to the [advent of code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Since I am finally learning Python I decided it would be time to pick up advent of code again and finally start sharing my code.

## Usage

The code is a fairly normal Python setup. I set it up using python venvs. All requirements are listed in the [`requirements.txt`](/requirements.txt) and the installation should work fine. I used Python 3.12 during the advent of code, so I don't know if will work years later.
